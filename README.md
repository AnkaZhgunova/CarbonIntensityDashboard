# Future Optimisations and Improvements

## I would suggest making the following improvements and additions by using an extended set of graph types and widgets.

Additional Graph Types: Incorporating a wider range of visualisations such as bar charts and scatter plots would allow users to interact with additional perspectives on carbon intensity data.

Data Aggregation Widgets: Adding widgets that display monthly or yearly trends based on the APIâ€™s historical data endpoints would enable users to see broader patterns and changes over time.

## Enhanced Real-Time Data Handling

Live Data Updates: Implementing WebSocket would enable the updating of displayed data in real time without requiring users to refresh.

Data Caching: Introducing a caching layer to store recent data would enhance loading times for users and also reduce repeated API requests.

## User-Centric Interface Features

Customisable Notifications: Allowing users to set thresholds for carbon intensity and receive alerts when levels reach certain points would, for example, help them optimise their energy usage.

Time Range Selection: Enabling users to select specific date ranges and/or customise the time intervals for the display of graphs would provide a more flexible user experience.


## Expanded Testing and Error Handling

Robust Testing: The coverage of tests should be increased in order to ensure smooth performance of the app and to enable potential issues to be proactively identified.

Improved Error Handling: Extending the app's error-handling logic to manage cases such as API rate limits and network outages gracefully, displaying clear, helpful messages to users.

## Adding APIs

Regional statistics: Adding APIs for obtaining regional, not just national statistics. It would be possible to give the user the ability to find out the carbon intensity in a certain region at a certain time.
